# February 4, 2013 was the last day that pennies were distributed by the Royal Canadian Mint.
# Now that pennies have been phased out retailers must adjust totals so that they are multiples of 5 cents
# when they are paid for with cash (credit card and debit card transactions continue to be charged to the penny).
# While retailers have some freedom in how they do this, most choose to round to the closest nickel.
# Write a program that reads prices from the user until a blank line is entered. Display the total cost of
# all the entered items on one line, followed by the amount due if the customer pays with cash on a second line.
# The amount due for a cash payment should be rounded to the nearest nickel.
# One way to compute the cash payment amount is to begin by determining how many pennies would be needed
# to pay the total. Then compute the remainder when this number of pennies is divided by 5.
# Finally, adjust the total down if the remainder is less than 2.5. Otherwise adjust the total up.

# pennie = 1
# pennie_per_nickel = 5
# nickel = 0.05
#
# total = 0.00
# price = float(input("Enter the total cost of all entered items: "))
#
# while price != " ":
#     total = float(total) + float(price)
#     price = input("Add item: ")
#     print("The amount is %.02f" % total)
#
# round = total * 100 % pennie_per_nickel
# if round < pennie_per_nickel / 2:
#     cash_total = total - round / 100
# else:
#     print("The cash amount payable is %.02f" % cash_total)

# Ex. 68
# sum = 0
# count = 0
#
# mark = input("Введите оценку :")
# if mark == "A+":
#      sum = sum + 4.0
# elif mark == "A":
#      sum = sum + 4.0
# elif mark == "A-":
#      sum = sum + 3.7
# elif mark == "B+":
#      sum = sum + 3.3
# count = count + 1
#
# mark = input()
# while mark != "":
#      if mark == "A+":
#           sum = sum + 4.0
#      elif mark == "A":
#           sum = sum + 4.0
#      elif mark == "A-":
#           sum = sum + 3.7
#      elif mark == "B+":
#           sum = sum + 3.3
#
#      count = count + 1
#
#      mark = input()
#
# average = sum / count
# print(f"Средняя оценка: {average}")

# Ex.74
# x = float(input())
# guess = x / 2
# print(guess)
# while abs(guess * guess - x) > 1e-12:
#      average = (guess + x / guess) / 2
#      guess = average
#      print(guess)
