# Read the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part
# of a meaningful message. Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3 up to (and including) 10 sides.
# If a number of sides outside this range is entered then your program should display an appropriate error message.

# Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually
# slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct
# for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years. The rules for determining whether or not
# a year is a leap year follow:
# • Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.
# • Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
# • Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
# • All other years are not leap years.
# Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.
#
# year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
# if year % 400 == 0 or year % 4 == 0:
#     print("This is Leap Year")
# elif year % 100 == 0:
#     print("This is not a Leap Year")
# else:
